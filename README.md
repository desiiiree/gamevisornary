I was born in Italy, Montepulciano the 2nd of July 2010, i grew up in England and sometimes visit Italy for holidays.
i love gun games, horror games, anime gamesect... and i want to make one! I also when im older want to be a game developer or software engineer, well, im not sure yet! i might even be a illustrator or a animator. mostly got inspired by my big sister

i know how to code using css, js, html, c++, and jQuery, to animate i use krita or csp (clip studio paint) and to draw i use the same!

Some links (will add more in the future) to my work is here!:
